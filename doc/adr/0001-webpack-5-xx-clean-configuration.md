# 1. Webpack 5.xx clean configuration

Date: 2023-11-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Create an empty project to experiment with the webpack 5.x configuration and step-by-step enable features required for migration

## Decision

start from scratch, based only on tools documentation, collect as much as possible information about configuration steps.

- webpack 5 [Basic Setup](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#basic-setup)

## Consequences

configuration will require multiple iterations, before it becomes a replacer for webpack 4.xx config
