# 3. Typescript Enabled solution

Date: 2023-11-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Enable typescript support for most tools in the project. `*.ts` files should become executable.

## Decision

added dependencies:

- typescript 5.xx
- ts-node
- @tsconfig/node18, https://github.com/tsconfig/bases
- @types/node

added additional types definitions:

- @types/webpack-dev-server
- Removed '@types/webpack' ref: https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/#typescript-typings

## Consequences

To verify the configuration added small test script, that added additional dependencies:

- debug
- glob
- type-fest

tsconfig.json is not complete, and will require additional changes.

Notes:

- https://github.com/tsconfig/bases - contains configuration for react-app, cypress, node18, etc.
- We will continue using this package for other steps.
